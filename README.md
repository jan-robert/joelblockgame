# Joel Block Game

### Introduction

Original Text from GitLab:
This is the best game ever. Period.

This was my second capstone project for my Computer Science degree. It's a Tetris-like game with the theme of our group's stupid inside joke.

## Dependencies
### Pygames

Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from python.org. Use python 3.7.7 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

> python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Run the game:

> python3 -m JoelTetris.py
