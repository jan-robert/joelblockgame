Hey I think I can implement colors on the shapes. Does not seem too difficult actually
Just wanted this text file so we can have it as reference to know which color is which.

Cyan- (0,255,255)
Magenta- (255,60,245)
Red- (255,45,45)
Lime Green- (55,255,65)
Yellow- (245,255,50)
Light Pink- (255,180,195)

It has been done
